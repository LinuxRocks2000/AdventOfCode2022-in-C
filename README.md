# My Advent Of Code 2022 solutions in C.

**SPOILER WARNING**

All of this is in valid C using standard libraries and some string manipulation code I wrote myself (in tylerLIB.h, please don't ask about the name, it's an inside joke :D)

Most of these are solutions to part 2. I haven't saved my solutions for each part 1. I might start doing that.
